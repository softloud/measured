	abstract = {Bayesian statistics, a currently controversial viewpoint concerning statistical inference, is based on a definition of probability as a particular measure of the opinions of ideally consistent people. Statistical inference is modification of these opinions in the light of evidence, and Bayes' theorem specifies how such modifications should be made. The tools of Bayesian statistics include the theory of specific distributions and the principle of stable estimation, which specifies when actual prior opinions may be satisfactorily approximated by a uniform distribution. A common feature of many classical significance tests is that a sharp null hypothesis is compared with a diffuse alternative hypothesis. Often evidence which, for a Bayesian statistician, strikingly supports the null hypothesis leads to rejection of that hypothesis by standard classical procedures. The likelihood principle emphasized in Bayesian statistics implies, among other things, that the rules governing when data collection stops are irrelevant to data interpretation. It is entirely appropriate to collect data until a point has been proven or disproven, or until the data collector runs out of time, money, or patience. (71 ref.)

	abstract = {Traditionally, statistical training has focused primarily on mathematical derivations and proofs of statistical tests. The process of developing the technical artifact—that is, the paper, dashboard, or other deliverable—is much less frequently taught, presumably because of an aversion to cookbookery or prescribing specific software choices. In this paper I argue that it’s critical to teach analysts how to go about developing an analysis in order to maximize the probability that their analysis is reproducible, accurate, and collaborative. A critical component of this is adopting a blameless postmortem culture. By encouraging the use of and fluency in tooling that implements these opinions, as well as a blameless way of correcting course as analysts encounter errors, we as a community can foster the growth of processes that fail the practitioners as infrequently as possible.},
