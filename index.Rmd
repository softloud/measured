My newfound role as a math-talking-doing-advocate grrl is an experiment. What if one practices science like music?

My goal is to spend four hours a day on deep work.

I use a combination of gtd, pomodoros, and bullet journaling in my productivity system.

And a toy elephant, along with a [digraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph).

How is my focus tracking over time? Am I improving?
