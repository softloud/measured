```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

I've previously written about [how cool I think testing is](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/03/13/ode-to-testing/), as well as [debugging](http://cantabile.rbind.io/posts/2018-11-12-testing-as-debugging/). 

I want to test a function, `varmaeta::effect_se` from a package I'm working from.

I'm pretty certain it takes log at times.  

```{r see function}
varameta::effect_se
```
